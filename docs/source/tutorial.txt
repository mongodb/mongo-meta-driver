======================
Build a MongoDB Driver
======================

Eventually, the MongoDB Meta Site will provide a clear and canonical
reference for the internal operation and construction of MongoDB
client libraries or "drivers." In the mean time the existing
:wiki:`Writing Drivers and Tools <Writing+Drivers+and+Tools>` page on
the :wiki:`MongoDB Wiki <>` provides a good starting point for
building these interfaces.

Also consider the `How to Build a MongoDB Driver
<http://www.10gen.com/presentations/mongosv-2011/how-to-build-a-mongodb-driver>`_
presentation on the 10gen website.
